Repository for R code written for homeworks. 
* Give your group a short name
* Code for each homework will go in a folder called "HomeworkX" for X=2, 3, 4, or 5.
* Add your group's homework to the appropriate folder with filename groupname.R

I recommend that you interact with the git repository through RStudio. 
See the  documentation from the RStudio site for information on 
installing git and creating an RStudio 
project from an existing git repository:
