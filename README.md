# SFUstat830
Repository for R code written for homeworks. Give your group a short name and create a directory for your group's work within each homework folder.
I recommend that you interact with the git repository through RStudio. 
See the  documentation from the RStudio site for information on 
installing git and creating an RStudio 
project from an existing git repository.
